# Overmorrow Theme

I really like [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson)'s theme, 
[Tomorrow Night Bright](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme), 
however, it was important for me to have distinct regular and bright colours, 
as well as to have distinct black, brblack, and background colours, and even 
more increased contrast on the forground colour. So, this is my tweaked version 
of [Tomorrow Night Bright](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) with 
such changes.
